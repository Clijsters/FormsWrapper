FormsWrapper
============

Simple way to implement awesome GUI &amp; TUI Features (+WinForms) in Batch and VBS

The development hasn't started yet.

### What should FormsWrapper do, when it is completed?
* Create Windows Forms with Batch and VBScript using simple syntax or config files (i.e. HMTL, XML, JSON)
* Raise Events and throw Exceptions which can be processed by the Scripts.
* Provide advanced features like multithreading, Queues, colored & interactive TUIs, Caching, ...
* (Is available as DLL for use with ScriptHost) 
	- For the moment I will only develop the app. Later there will be a DLL and a PowerShell Script.

### What's with PowerShell?
Nothing yet.
